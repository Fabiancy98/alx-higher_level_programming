# More Classes and Objects
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 5.1.16(1)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.10.4
* C files are compiled using `gcc (Debian 11.3.0-1) 11.3.0`
* Tested on Debian 10 Buster
